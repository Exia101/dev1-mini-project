              <h2>What is Artificial Superintelligence?</h2>
              <p>Definition: A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds</p>
            </div>

            <div class="AI">
              <h3>Definition of artificial superintelligence according to Nick Bostrom:</h3>
            <p>&#34;The concept of artificial superintelligence roughly means any kind of intellect that vastly outstrips anything that&#39;s possible for humans to do.It would just be a really clever human,it would be a large ,by a huge amount superior to us.It wouldn&#39;t be a confusion about whether it really was very smart or not,it would be on a completely different level.&#34;
            <hr>
            A quote from Sir Martin Rees

            &#34;We obviously can&#39;t conceive what a superintelligence might be able to achieve ,any more than a dog can appreciate quantum mechanics.But we can at least quantify things by thinking about computers.&#39;</p>

              <h2>What if it has already happened?</h2>
              <p>There is a hypothesis called the simulation hypothesis that contends that reality is in fact a simulation, of which we, the simulants, are totally unaware.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="AI">
              <h2>Implications of this hypothesis</h2>
              <p>The consequences of such a hypothesis are profound.It means that artificial superintelligence has already taken place at some point in the future and we are merely a creation in a massively complex simulation.It also means that we are not real in the sense we think of something being real.

            <div class="AI">
              <p>In a multiverse,there would almost certainly be beings that have evolved intelligence way beyond ours,with the power to run immensely complicated simulations.Our whole universe could be one of those simulations.

              <h2>-What is the limit of such an invention?</h2>
              <p>The limit of such a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue.It’s only limit will be the laws of physics.</p>
              <p>There are no size limitations,since such an invention could be as large as a warehouse,or even larger.Unlike the human,which must fit within the cranium.

              <h2>The Transhuman era </h2>
              <p>According to Nick Bostrom the human intelligence will be amplified within the next decades.</p>
              <p>According to the futuretimeline.net, human intelligence will be vastly amplified by AI by 2100.Rather than being separate entities,these AI programs will often merge with human minds,greatly extending the latter&#39;s capability.That means that super intelligent AI will exist in two forms.One,by acting as a separate entity and two by merging with humans.

            <div class="AI">
              <p>The benefits of this human-AI merger require the extensive use of implants, however – something which a significant minority of the population still refuses to accept. Compared to transhumans, these non-upgraded humans are becoming like cavemen – thousands of years behind in intellectual development.* Unable to comprehend the latest technology, the world around them appears "fast" and "strange" from their increasingly limited perspective.* This is creating a major division in society.

              <p>For the sceptics out there,the information that is published on this article of the website futuretimeline.net is an extract from Ray Kurzweil’s book “The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology”.</p>

            <div class="AI">
              <h2>Another extract of Ray Kurzweil’s book “The Singularity is Near” </h2>
              <p>"An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century — it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity — technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence..."

              <p>Artificial Superintelligence will be the last invention of humans,since the vastly more powerful AI will be much better at this than humans. </p>

            <div class="AI">
              <h2>Personal views:</h2>
              <p>Superintelligent AI will surpass human level intelligent and will merge with it.That is inevitable.My opinion is that we have to take into consideration various ethical problems that might occur when this transition happens.One hypothetical problem that Nick Bostrom set was that a superintelligent machine might decide to terminate a significant percentage of the human population after being fed with an extremely difficult mathematical problem that was given to it by humans.The reason why it would do this is in order to increase it’s processing power.In such a scenario,if no ethical considerations have been taken when designing this machine,it could lead to catastrophic consequences for the human race.</p>
