			<h3>PERSONAL SUMMARY</h3>
				<p>I am known by my friends to be honest and respectful which are my key moral values which are close to my heart. I believe in recognizing others for their achievements and helping those who need guidance. Open thinking is crucial in competitive markets and showing enterprise is key to distinguish the brand from other retailers. Being a team player to work towards achieving more is something I always like to improve; customers expect honest opinions and also information regarding goods. They will also want to feel they are getting high level of customer service and feel valued. As a person I am naturally energetic and a bring burst of energy into the team. My team building skills have been improved in the time I been working in John Lewis Kingston. Through experience I believe being independent is also essential when you’re left to do a task. I take passion in my work and always have high standard of finish which motivates me. Flexibility is essential in a very competitive market.</p>

		John Lewis Partnership Aug 2010- May 2012

	Kingston Branch

	Customer collection / Stock management

	I worked for John Lewis Partnership for 21 month working in the stock management. This is a diverse department where I was trained and acquired skills in many aspects of the business; from offloading loads, managing traffic to CQM where I follow a customer complaint up and resolve the matter. My main role was to serve customers who have come to pick up their purchases which can be via car, foot or click and collect. On busy days I was assigned to click & collect as I was confident and also very efficient at crowd management and resolving any queries or problems efficiently. There be times where I be designated to stock management roles where I be busy storing stock into warehouse or picking stock for customers who have purchased the stock. In this time I have learned a lot from working with different types of customers and dealing with new problems which has improved my people skills. I have delivered customer service which excels the customers expectation ensuring the customer leaves the store with a smile on their face.
