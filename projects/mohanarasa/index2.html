  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>A front end web developer from Surrey and a graduate from the University of Greenwich with a 2:1 honors degree in BSc Web Technologies.

The tools I used to get the job done are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Photoshop, Github and Sublime text editor. I’ve got a strong technical background who possesses self-discipline and the ability to work with the minimum of supervision. Having exposure to a wide range of technologies & able to play a key role in diagnosing hardware and software problems and to ensure that quality solutions meet business objectives.
