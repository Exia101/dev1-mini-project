        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>There are millions of stars and planets in our galaxy but there is only one that we can call home, that planet is called Earth. Currently, we are polluting the planet with more CO2 than ever before. This has a major effect on the planet in more ways than one and it effects us too. It is our duty as inhabitants of this planet to keep it safe for future generations to come.</p>
