          <p>There are millions of stars and planets in our galaxy but there is only one that we can call home, that planet is called Earth. Currently, we are polluting the planet with more CO2 than ever before. This has a major effect on the planet in more ways than one and it effects us too. It is our duty as inhabitants of this planet to keep it safe for future generations to come.</p>

          <p>Solar takes advantage of a free and powerful energy source – the sun. In a single hour, the sun transmits more energy to the earth's surface than the world uses in a year. Solar converts this energy into electricity, making it a simple, clean and cost-effective way to power our lives. It’s dependable, too – because unlike fossil fuels, the sun’s energy is unlimited. Just imagine what that could do for your wallet, your bottom line and the environment.</p>

          <p>Wind turbines are used to generate electricity from the kinetic power of the wind. Historical they were more frequently used as a mechanical device to turn machinery. There are two main kinds of wind generators, those with a vertical axis, and those with a horizontal axis. Wind turbines can be used to generate large amounts of electricity in wind farms both onshore and offshore</p>
