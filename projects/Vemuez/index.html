            <p>There are millions of stars and planets in our galaxy but there is only one that we can call home, that planet is called Earth. Currently, we are polluting the planet with more CO2 than ever before. This has a major effect on the planet in more ways than one and it effects us too. It is our duty as inhabitants of this planet to keep it safe for future generations to come.</p>

          <h3>Fossil Fuel</h3>
          <p>Fossil Fuel is a form of nonrenewable energy which is a resource that can’t be replaced as easily in conjunction with the high levels of consumption that we manage today. Burning fossil fuels negatively affects the environment because they release carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which contributes to global climate change.</p>

        <div id="sun">
          <h3>Sun</h3>
          <p>Light from the sun travels millions of miles across space, through our atmosphere and to us, providing warmth, visual light and vital energy needed for life. The raw input enerfy from the sun absorbed by earth land and sea is 3.85 Yotta Joules; in one hour the sun provides enough energy than what we consume in an entire year. Utilising it, we are able to cut down on burning fossil fuel and help reduce global climate change</p>
        </div>
        <div id="wind">
          <h3>Wind</h3>
          <p>Wind is caused by air flowing from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. About 2% of the total of the suns energy is then converted into wind energy. It is produced by the uneven heating of the earth’s surface by the sun. Since the earth’s surface is made of various land and water formations, it absorbs the sun’s radiation unevenly. Making this a renewable resource that can be harnessed to provide energy and also help to reduce global climate change</p>

          <p>Solar takes advantage of a free and powerful energy source – the sun. In a single hour, the sun transmits more energy to the earth's surface than the world uses in a year. Solar converts this energy into electricity, making it a simple, clean and cost-effective way to power our lives. It’s dependable, too – because unlike fossil fuels, the sun’s energy is unlimited. Just imagine what that could do for your wallet, your bottom line and the environment.</p>

        <div id="windTurbine">
          <p>Wind turbines are used to generate electricity from the kinetic power of the wind. Historical they were more frequently used as a mechanical device to turn machinery. There are two main kinds of wind generators, those with a vertical axis, and those with a horizontal axis. Wind turbines can be used to generate large amounts of electricity in wind farms both onshore and offshore</p>
