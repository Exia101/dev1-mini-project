		<h2>Story of the Day</h2>
		<p>The Godfather of Grime, Wiley, has recently announced on twitter that he is currently working on a joint album with Boy Better Know member, JME. This has come as a suprise to many considering that Wiley hasn't released an album since 2014 and he isn't the type to do collaboration albums. He has also announced that he is doing a solo album entitled 'Godfather' which is due to be released to the public on September 2nd 2016.</p>

		<h2>Artists of the Week</h2>
		<p>No.1 on the list for artist of the week is someone of many names, whether you know him as Hollowman, The Godfather of Rap, or the Street's Prophet, Giggs (formerly known as 'Giggler') has shown over the years that he is a force to be reckoned with in the UK rap scene. From the success of his first album, Walk In Da Park, which was released in 2006 to his most recent album entitled 'Landlord', it is clear that Giggs has grown both as a man and as an artist. Landord has done very well in the very few weeks that is has been available, especially considering that Giggs has received his well deserved praise in the form of a number 2 position in the charts. He recently also performed at the Reading Festival as well in Leeds, where he absolutely lit the stage on fire and created an atmosphere like no other artist on the line-up with his performance of hits from the album including 'Whipping Excursion' and he even joined JME on stage to perform the well-known track 'Man Don't Care'. Support his new album by downloading it on iTunes or streaming through Spotify.</p>
