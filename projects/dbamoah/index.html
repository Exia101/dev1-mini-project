		<h2>Story of the Day</h2>
		<p>The Godfather of Grime, Wiley, has recently announced on twitter that he is currently working on a joint album with Boy Better Know member, JME. This has come as a suprise to many considering that Wiley hasn't released an album since 2014 and he isn't the type to do collaboration albums. He has also announced that he is doing a solo album entitled 'Godfather' which is due to be released to the public on September 2nd 2016.</p>
